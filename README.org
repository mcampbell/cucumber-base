#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* ~cucumber-base~
A simple container with ruby and cucumber, and whatever else I might
need to make cucumber/ruby tests.

~ENTRYPOINT~ is simply ~cucumber~, with no ~CMD~'s so you can put
whatever args on the end you feel like using, including ~--init~.

** Running
You are expected to map your current dir to some place in the
container, then use that place as your workdir.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker run -it -v $(pwd):/usr/src/myapp -w /usr/src/myapp <cucumber args go here>
#+END_SRC
